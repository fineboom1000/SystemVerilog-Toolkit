/*
How it works from a stand point of how one could have come
up with this themself.


The entire process is simply decoding hex as an output.

We start off understanding that the input signals we can 
recieve are binary, hence we create a 4-b vector hex as we know
that we want to map hex values to outputs. You should also
realize that we will really need to have a binary to hex to
display map (as opposed to an inital thought of recieving 
hex)...
So, if it is unclear to you why one would be motavated to 
call this hex, all you are doing is saying 4-bit input represents
0-15, and we will see that the case maps it to segment patterns.

We know that one way or another, this input of binary needs
to map onto some hex value by virture of a LED display.

That is done like so,
4 bits have 2^4 or 16 values.
Thus it make sense that we can create 16 statements 
and have each one map to a specific hex value:
1, 2, ... d, e.

The idea of a multiplexing route comes to mind, and
that is why we see a case(hex) used. Only one number is 
displayed at a time, and these cases should be mutually 
exclusive. (What if there were n displays? Hint: just replicate!)

We are simply saying that if a binary input of (x)_2
enters, the case of 4'hy  = (x)_2 should execute. Ergo, 
that should mean the leds on our display should light up
in such a manner that they display a hex value(0-15)—
which is done with the assignment of the 6-vector sseg to 
the correct active low input.

Now notice, our output is 8 bits, yet we only needed(and have) seven lights.
The last, extra guy, can be used for a decimal point;
go back up in your code and add that logic in. This does not
belong in the case statement, it is a choice each mux 
route needs to think about, thus add it outside of case.
